Waste management refers to the safe collection, transport, processing, recycling, and disposal of waste materials.
Types of waste include biodegradable (food scraps, garden waste, paper), non-biodegradable (plastic, metals, glass, electronics), hazardous (chemicals, batteries, medical and industrial waste), e-waste (old electronics), and construction/demolition waste (bricks, concrete, wood).
Proper waste segregation at the source improves recycling efficiency, reduces pollution, and protects human health.
Biodegradable waste can be processed into compost or biogas, while non-biodegradable waste can be recycled into new products.
Hazardous waste must be handled carefully according to certified disposal systems and regulations.
E-waste should be reused or recycled safely and never dumped in landfills.
Solid waste management strategies include source reduction, recycling, composting, energy recovery, and landfilling.
Poor waste management causes soil contamination, water pollution from leachate, air pollution, health hazards, and greenhouse gas emissions.
Government initiatives include Swachh Bharat Mission, E-waste Management Rules, Hazardous Waste Management Rules, and Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR).
Technology and AI help predict waste trends, optimize collection routes, sort waste with computer vision, track recycling, and create awareness through apps and chatbots.
Responsibilties ofCampuses and individuals should segregate waste, low plastics usage, compost organic waste, reuse items, encourage recycling, and educate peers.
Energy conservation includes turning off devices, using energy-efficient appliances, and maximizing natural lighting.
Water conservation involves rainwater harvesting, fixing leaks, and reducing wastage.
Recycling stations should handle paper, plastic, metal, and e-waste safely.
Carbon footprint can be reduced by walking, cycling, using public transport, supporting renewable energy, and planting trees.
Climate action involves sustainable energy, monitoring emissions, and educating students.
Campus sustainability practices include awareness programs, paperless submissions, sustainable procurement, smart irrigation, energy monitoring, sustainable transportation, food waste reduction, green buildings, pollution prevention, and real-time dashboards.
